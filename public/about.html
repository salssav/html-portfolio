<p>I was born in Monterrey, Mexico. But havelived in Mexico City for most of my life. This past years Ive had the privilege of living abroad
  with my family in Europe. I lived in Paris for some months, and most recently in Lisbon, before coming back to Mexico City.
  The main reason why Im back here is because Im trying to help out my bestfriend in making his skatebrand come to life. 
</p>

<p>I looove skateboarding. I got into it when I was around 16/17 years old. And im very lucky to have met the most amazing people throught skating. 
  I think what I like the most is being able to go anywere in the world and finding a community throught skating.</p>


<p>Besides skating, I also love filmmaking, eventhought Ive been putting it on hold for a bit now. ( I should really get back into it ASAP). I also love anything and everything analog. From old videocams, to videogames, movies, you name it. 
Most recebtly, I got myself into doing pixel art, which I have been really enjoying. As well as web design and now programing.

<p>My goal for this upcoming months is to be able to design and develop any website I can think of from scratch. I would absolutelty love to live from UI design and programming, as well as leeeping skating and art as a hobbie.</p>
